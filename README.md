pdu-converter
=============
This class encodes a message and a delivery mobilephone number to PDU-Format. It can be used to send text messages by older mobilephones (e.g. Siemens used PDU format) via serial port (serial communication not included).

To test the PDU converted command you can connect your mobile phone with e.g. HyperTerminal and send the encoded string to your phone.

Messaging services may cause additional costs. (Ask your provider for further information)
