pdu-converter
=============
This class encodes an message and a delivery mobilenumber to PDU-Format. It can be used to send SMS over older mobilephones (e.g. Siemens used PDU format) via serial port (serial communication not included).

To test the PDU converted command you can connect to your mobile phone with e.g. HyperTerminal and send the encoded string to your phone.

Sending sms may cause additional costs.
